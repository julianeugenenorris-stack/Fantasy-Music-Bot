Fantasy Music Discord Bot

This is a discord bot that can host drafts for the users of a discord server and track each players artists over a year to select a winner.

How It's Made:

Tech used: PYTHON, ORACLE CLOUD

This was my attempt to learn more about python through a fun medium. I have always thought this idea was cool and I found out that discord has a pretty intuivtive api and bot that I could use to improve my general python knowledge. I also wanted to expirement with hosting it on a cloud as it is pretty lightweight and oracle offers a free cloud hosting service that I can use to learn.

Optimizations

I learned how to save classes instead of multiple independ arrays allowing me to just have to save and load a single file containing a single class. It has some work to be done in the optimization efforts but that will come once I feel the general outline is good enough to be used broadly.I also was able to split up the functions into different files for readability sake, instead of having everything in main. 

Lessons Learned:

Comment early and comment often. It is much easier to make comments as they are needed instead of having to go back over the whole project to recomment on each function and method. Also stick to one naming convention, it makes it prettier and more readable. It isn't too bad in this project but it could use a lookover after.

Future Plans:

Finish scoring system. Add customization options through the /createdraft like how things are scored and what is enabled. Also a general recommenting of each function and class with a look at general naming conventions. This project is a long way from done!
